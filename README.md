Create a login form in html

**Reasoning:**

```
Okay, the user wants me to create a login form in HTML. Let me think about the basic structure.

First, I'll start with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration. Then the html tag with a head and body. In the head, I should include a title, maybe "Login Form". 

In the body, I need a form element. The form should have action and method attributes. Since it's a login form, the method should be POST for security. The action can be set to "/" or maybe just leave it as an empty string if there's no backend yet.

Now, the form elements. A label for the username/email, an input field of type text. Then a label for the password with an input of type password. Both inputs should have names, like "username" and "password". 

I should include a submit button inside the form. Also, maybe add some classes or IDs for styling later, but the user didn't mention CSS, so maybe keep it simple without extra styling.

Wait, the user said to write clean and complete code without explanations. So just the basic HTML. Let me make sure all tags are properly closed. The form's closing tag is important. Let me check the structure again.

Labels should be associated with the inputs using the for attribute matching the input's id. That's good practice. So each input gets an id like "username" and "password", and the labels reference those.

Putting it all together, the code should look like this:
